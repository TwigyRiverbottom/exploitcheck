### Step 12: Add validation
We need to validate against the learner's pull request title. This information is accessible to us [:book: from the payload](https://lab.github.com/docs/events#accessing-event-payloads) that is sent with the event. In this case, the information was sent from a `pull_request.opened` event.

You can see an example of all the information sent [in the GitHub Developer docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-26). 

We'll add the [:book: `left:` option](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/gate/#options) to the gate, and compare its value to the expected pull request's title.

A completed example of this would look as follows, with comments on the right starting with a hash `#`:
```yaml
actions:
- type: gate                            # using the gate action
  left: '%payload.pull_request.title%'  # get the title from the pull request object inside of the payload
  operator: ===                         # check for strict equality, see more at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators#Identity
  right: Add name to README             # this is the expected value
```

### :keyboard: Activity: Adding validation

1. Add a `left:` option to the gate
1. Set the gate's `left:` option to the pull request's title which is `'%payload.pull_request.title%'`
1. Set the gate's `operator:` to `===`
1. Set the gate's `right:` to the title we expect which is `Add name to README`
