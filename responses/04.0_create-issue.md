Great! Now let's work on the `before:` block.

### `before:`
Anything in this block occurs before the learner can access their course repository.

### Learning Lab actions
Actions are reusable modules that each course has access to. They are each designed to do very specific things, and nothing more. This is to optimize for reusability and simplicity. The documentation contains a listing of [:book: all available actions](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/).

## Step 7: Add to the `before` block

We'll use the [:book: `createIssue` action](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/createIssue/) to create an issue for the learner with some initial instructions. The `createIssue` action requires two [:book: options](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/createIssue/#options):
- a title
- the body of the response

We'll define both of those here, but we'll create the body in the next step.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add the `createIssue` action

1. Add a `createIssue` action in the `before:` block
    - Note: Since there are multiple suggested changes, you can go to the "Files changed" tab and [accept them as a batch](https://help.github.com/articles/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request/)
