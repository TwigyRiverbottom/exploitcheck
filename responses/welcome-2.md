### New to GitHub?

For this course, you'll need to know how to create a branch on GitHub, commit changes using Git, and open a pull request on GitHub. If you need a refresher on the GitHub flow, check out [the Introduction to GitHub course]({{ host}}/courses/introduction-to-github).

You'll also need a general understanding of webhooks and the GitHub API.  [The Getting started with GitHub Apps course]({{ host}}/courses/getting-started-with-github-apps) is a good place to start.
