### Course metadata
Remember your course's metadata, near the top of your config? We left the description and tagline empty at the start of this course, but it's now time to fill them in.

The [:book: course description and tagline](https://lab.github.com/docs/content-for-the-catalog#fields-used-for-the-catalog) will be included on the Learning Lab site. Users will see this information before they sign up for the course.

## Step 2: Add course information

Now, it's time to add a course description and tagline.
