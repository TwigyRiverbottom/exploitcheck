Great! The title will appear anywhere the course is referenced. We'll fill in some more of the course metadata later. First, let's get into its foundation.

### Template Repositories
Most courses make use of a [:book: template repository](https://lab.github.com/docs/course-ownership-and-repositories#the-repositories). Template repositories are cloned for the learner and can contain starter code or resources to help them find their way.

When creating or choosing a template repository for your course, consider two main points.

First, how will this content help teach the concept? For example, if a course is teaching HTML, the success of the finished product should feature HTML.

Second, is the finished product useful? At the end of the course, the finished repository should serve a purpose aside from the lessons. A working game, a portfolio or resume, or a collection of template documents are a few examples.

## Step 4: Designate a template repository
Let's add our own template repository. To speed things up, we've created a template repository for you. We recommend using our template for this course.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a template repository
