When your learner is successful, gates let the actions that follow execute.

Let's respond to the learner by commenting in their pull request. We'll let them know they've completed our course.

### :keyboard: Activity: Responding to successful actions

1. In the same step, add a [:book: `respond` action](https://lab.github.com/docs/actions/respond/)
1. Add a `with: pr-opened.md` option for the response file

You can also accept the suggested changes below. You don't need to worry about the `pr-opened.md` file, since [we created it]({{ fileUrl }}) for you, but feel free to change its contents.
