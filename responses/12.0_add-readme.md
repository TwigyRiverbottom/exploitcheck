### Course README
Our last step is to create a [:book: `README.md` file](https://lab.github.com/docs/content-for-the-catalog#fields-used-for-the-catalog). This file will show on Learning Lab as users register. This file should contain learning outcomes and some long form content.

## Step 14: Add a README.md file

We added a README for you, but go ahead and put in your own content.
